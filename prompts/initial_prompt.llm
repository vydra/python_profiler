We want to implement a profiler class that can capture execution times in various places of
our python program.

The profiler will support execution with loops.
We want to arbitrarily time the execution of any segment of code.
We will give each code segment a name.

Computer average duration for a scope given the iteration number of its parent scope.

Parameters: segment_name, start time, end time
Time to be measured in millis.

Example usage:

```python
 profiler = Profiler()
 profiler.record("segment A", start, end)
  profiler.record("segment B", start, end)
 profiler.numberOfExecutions() -> int
 profiler.listSegments() -> list[str]
 profiler.iterationData(1) -> record
 ```

 Generate python class Profiler to support above behavior.
